This is a simple tribute page website of the music producer, Metro Boomin (this may be version 1). This version uses:
- the flexbox layout method for the responsive design of the website

PURPOSE:
- To develop very basic knowledge about HTML and CSS
- To create a simple informational website that introduces me to responsive web design
